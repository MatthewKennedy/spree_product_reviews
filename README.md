    ```

    ```

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.


## Usage

Reviews will be up and running out of the box, but you will most likely want to place elements such as the stars and reviews where you prefer.
To do this disable the default placement of review elements in your product page by setting the preference below in your spree.rb initializer file.

```ruby
SpreeProductReviews::Config.disable_default_review_placment = true
```

Use the following partials where you like:

Adds star rating with context and options to view and review:
```ruby
<%= render 'spree/shared/price_stars', stars: @product.stars %>
```

Shows only the stars:
```ruby
<%= render 'spree/reviews/stars', stars: @product.stars %>
```

This partial is used to show recent reviews:
```ruby
<%= render 'spree/shared/reviews', stars: @product.stars %>
```

You can also customize the stars by creating a custom CSS file and setting the variables seen in spree_product_reviews_vars.scss


## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_product_reviews/factories'
```
